# Share Editor

Share Editor is a simple utility that helps user to watch and edit shared text. User should use
it as a middle app. For instance, user wants to share some data from A-app to B-app, but user
doesn't know what exactly A-app will send. So, user can share the data to Share Editor, look at it
(maybe edit) and send the data forward to B-app.
